# harbour-scribble
Scribble is a fast and lightweight app for hand drawings and sketches.

It offers some tweaks like painting on background images, adjusting colors / strokewidth or two-finger clicks for straight lines. 

## Deprecated
You may even disable system gestures, if they get in your way while drawing. A small lock symbol reminds you to re-enable them in order to close the app later.
